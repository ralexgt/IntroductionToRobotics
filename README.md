## [Homework #1](#hw1) <a name="hw1"></a>

- **Description** </br>
  This assigment focuses on controlling each channel of an RGB LED using individual potentiometeres.
  </br></br>

- **Requirements** </br>

  - **Technical task** </br>
    Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically, you need to read the potentiometerâ€™s value with Arduino and then write a mapped value to the LED pins.
  - **Components** </br>
    _ RGB LED (at least 1);
    _ Potentiometers (at least 3); \* Resistors and wires as needed;
